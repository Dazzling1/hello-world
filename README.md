Creating a new repository
I am moving through the instructions very slowly and at this time I can recall doing the following: create a repository with readme branch named readme-edits.
when making entries and saved its called commits. Commits message tells why changes have been made. :) This has been my attempt to describe a commit message, but I have not made changes yet because I still do not know enough that allows me to identify any incorrect issues.
